# ðŸ§  `ct.css` â€“ Letâ€™s take a look inside your `<head>`

Your `<head>` is the single biggest render-blocking part of your pageâ€”ensuring
it is well-formed is critical. `ct.css` is a diagnostic CSS snippet that exposes
potential performance issues in your pageâ€™s `<head>` tags.

## Example Output

![](./demo.png)

* **Red:** This is an error and should be addressed.
* **Orange:** This could be problematic in certain scenarios.
* **Green:** This is fine and is purely informational.
* **Solid:** This file is the problem.
* **Dashed:** Another file(s) are causing problems with this file.

## Simple Usage

Paste this anywhere in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://csswizardry.com/ct/ct.css" class="ct" />
```

```

## Limitations

* **Non-matching `media` types:** Currently, `ct.css` only takes print
  stylesheets into account. This means that you may experience false-positives
  for other non-blocking stylesheets.
* **Injected `script` elements:** `ct.css`, as with all CSS, acts against the
  DOM and not the HTML. As such, injected `script` elements will be falsely
  flagged as blocking.
  * Similarly, any `script` elements that are removed from the DOM will not be
    flagged.
* **Third-party blocking resources:** The check for whether or not something is
  a third party is naive at best.
* **CSP Issues:** If your app is blocking CSS from the `csswizardry.com` origin,
  either self-host the `ct.css` file, or paste its contents into `<style
  class="ct">â€¦</style>` tags anywhere in your page.
